Consensys Software Inc. (“Consensys,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is the leading blockchain software development company. With a focus on utilizing decentralized technologies, such as Ethereum, our software is powering a revolution in commerce and finance and helping to optimize business processes. Consensys hosts a top level domain website, https://consensys.io/, that serves information regarding Consensys and our products and services (collectively, the “Offerings”), as well as sub-domains for our products or services (the top level domain with the sub-domains collectively referred to as the “Site”), which include text, images, audio, code and other materials or third party information.

These Terms of Use, including their appendix (the “Terms,” “Terms of Use” or “Agreement”) contain the terms and conditions that govern your access to and use of the Site and Offerings provided by us and is an agreement between us and you or the entity you represent (“you” or “your”). Please read these Terms of Use carefully before using the Site or Offerings. By using the Site, clicking a button or checkbox to accept or agree to these Terms where that option is made available, clicking a button to use or access any of the Offerings, completing an Order, or, if earlier, using or otherwise accessing the Offerings (the date on which any of the events listed above occur being the “Effective Date”), you (1) accept and agree to these Terms and any additional terms that apply to certain Additional Offerings (as defined below), rules and conditions of participation issued by Consensys from time to time and (2) consent to the collection, use, disclosure and other handling of information as described in our Privacy Notice. If you do not agree to the Terms or perform any and all obligations you accept under the Terms, then you may not access or use the Offerings.

You represent to us that you are lawfully able to enter into contracts. If you are entering into this Agreement for an entity, such as the company you work for, you represent to us that you have legal authority to bind that entity. Please see Section 13 for definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement.

In addition, you represent to us that you are (1) not subject to sanctions or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted parties, including but not limited to the lists maintained by the United Nations Security Council, the U.S. Government (i.e., the Specially Designated Nationals List and Foreign Sanctions Evaders List of the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Entity List of the U.S. Department of Commerce), the European Union or its Member States, the United Kingdom, or other applicable government authority and (2) not located in any country subject to a comprehensive sanctions program implemented by the United States.

1. The Offerings.

1.1 Generally. You may access and use the Offerings only in accordance with this Agreement. You agree to comply with the terms of this Agreement and all laws, rules and regulations applicable to your use of the Offerings.

1.2 Offerings and Access. Consensys offers a number of Offerings under the Consensys brand or brands owned by us. These include Infura, MetaMask and others. Offerings are generally accessed through the Site or through a third party provider of which we approved, such as the Google Play or Apple App stores, unless otherwise agreed in writing. Some Offerings may require you to create an account with Consensys, enter a valid form of payment, and select a paid plan (a “Paid Plan”), or initiate an Order.

1.3 Third-Party Content and Services. In certain Offerings, including MetaMask Swaps, Bridging, Staking, and Snaps, you may view, have access to, and may use the informational content, products, or services of one or more third parties (“Third Party Content” and “Third Party Services” respectively). In each such case, you agree that you view, access or use such content and services at your own election. Your reliance on any Third Party Content and use of Third Party Services in connection with the Offerings is governed on one hand by this Agreement but, on the other, will also generally be subject to separate terms and conditions set forth by the applicable third party content and/or service provider. Those terms and conditions may involve separate fees and charges or may include disclaimers or risk warnings about reliance on or the accuracy of any information. Such terms may also apply a privacy policy different than that which Consensys maintains and incorporates into this Agreement. It is your responsibility to understand the terms and conditions of Third Party Services, including how those service providers use any of your information under their privacy policies.

Third Party Content and Third Party Services are provided for your convenience only. We do not verify, curate, or control Third Party Content. We do not control Third Party Services. As a result, we do not guarantee, endorse, or recommend such content or services to any or all users of the Offerings, or the use of such content or services for any particular purpose. You access, rely upon or use any Third Party Content or Third Party Service at your own risk. Consensys disclaims all responsibility and liability for any Losses on account of your reliance upon or use of such content or services. We have no responsibility for Third Party Content that may be misleading, incomplete, erroneous, offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable to you or under the law in your jurisdiction. The choice to rely on Third Party Content or to use a Third Party Service is your own, and you are solely responsible for ensuring that your reliance or use is in compliance with all applicable laws. Dealing or correspondence with any third party that provides such content or services is solely between you and that third party. We reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, disable, or impose access restrictions or limits on the use of any Third Party Service at any time without notice.

1.4 Support. You may seek or receive technical or product support, information, advice, or guidance from us regarding the Offerings, including via third party service provider, chat interface, or email. All support made available or provided by or on behalf of Consensys is believed to be reliable, but we do not make representations or warranties, express or implied, as to its accuracy, its completeness, or the results to be obtained. Such support is being provided for informational purposes only and, by accepting such support, you are representing that you have adequate skill and experience regarding the proper selection, use, and/or application of Offerings and use such Offerings at your own discretion and risk. With the exception of instances of gross negligence, you hold us harmless for any injury that may result from the support you receive from us. You are aware that our customer support efforts may be impersonated by malicious third parties, and you agree that we are not responsible for the actions of such impersonators. You further acknowledge that we will not offer support via SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram, WeChat, or Twitter DMs, and that we will never ask you for your private key or secret recovery phrase or for you to make a payment to us.

2. Changes.

2.1 To the Offerings. We may change or discontinue any or all of the Offerings or change or remove functionality of any or all of the Offerings from time to time. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to communicate to you any discontinuation of an Offering through the Site or public communication channels. If you are on a Paid Plan, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to communicate to you any discontinuation of the Offering at least 30 days in advance of such discontinuation, and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to continue supporting the Offering for up to three months after the discontinuation, except if doing so (a) would pose an information security or intellectual property issue, (b) is economically or technically burdensome, or (c) would create undue risk of us violating the law.

2.2 To this Agreement. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace any part of this Agreement or any Policies at any time. It is your responsibility to check this Agreement periodically for changes, but we will also use commercially reasonable efforts to communicate any material changes to this Agreement through the Site, email (if you have an account), or public channels. You agree that your continued use of or access to the Offerings following the posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes acceptance of those changes, whether or not you were checking for changes or actually read the changes.

3. Your Responsibilities.

3.1 Use of the Offerings. For any Offerings, whether they require that you set up an account with Consensys (such as Diligence) or they do not (such as MetaMask), and except to the extent caused by our breach of this Agreement, (a) you are responsible for all activities that occur with respect to your use of the Offerings, regardless of whether the activities are authorized by you or undertaken by you, your employees or a third party (including your contractors, agents or other End Users), and (b) we and our affiliates are not responsible for unauthorized access to the Offerings or your account, including any access that occurred as a result of fraud, phishing, or other criminal activity perpetrated against you by third parties. You will ensure that your use of the Offerings does not violate any applicable law.

3.2 Your Security and Backup. You are solely responsible for properly configuring and using the Offerings and otherwise taking appropriate action to secure, protect, and backup your accounts and/or Your Content in a manner that will provide appropriate security and protection, which might include use of encryption. If you are not able to be responsible for your own account security, or do not want such an obligation, then you should not use the Offerings. Your obligations under this Agreement include ensuring any available software updates or upgrades to an Offering you are using are promptly installed or implemented, and recording and securely maintaining any passwords or secret recovery phrases that relate to your use of the Offerings. You acknowledge that certain methods of securing your secret recovery phrase, such as storing it as a digital file anywhere, including on your personal device or on a cloud storage provider, increase the risk that your account or secret recovery phrase will be compromised. You further acknowledge that you will not share with us nor any other third party any password or secret recovery phrase that relates to your use of the Offerings, and that we will not be held responsible if you do share any such password or phrase, whether you do so knowingly or unknowingly. For the avoidance of doubt, we take no responsibility whatsoever for any theft of a secret recovery phrase that involved intrusion through any means into your personal device or a cloud provider’s data repository.

3.3 Log-In Credentials and API Authentication. To the extent we provide you with log-in credentials and API authentication generated by the Offerings, such log-in credentials and API authentication are for your use only and you will not sell, transfer, or sublicense them to any other entity or person, except that you may disclose your password or private key to your agents and subcontractors performing work on your behalf.

3.4 Applicability to Offerings that facilitate access to addresses on blockchain protocols. For the avoidance of doubt, the terms of this Section 3 are applicable to all Offerings such as MetaMask through which you generate a public/private key pair (which can be thought of as a blockchain account and related password) either with a blockchain protocol directly or with Third Party Offerings, such as decentralized applications. You are solely responsible for the use and security of these security keys and that we will not be held responsible if you share any keys or secret recovery phrases with anyone else, whether knowingly or unknowingly.

4. Fees and Payment.

4.1 Publicly Available Offerings. Some Offerings may be offered to the public and licensed on a royalty free basis, including Offerings that require a Paid Plan for software licensing fees above a certain threshold of use. These terms apply to all Offerings regardless of whether they require a Paid Plan.

4.2 Offering Fees. If your use of an Offering does not require an Order or Paid Plan but software licensing fees are charged contemporaneously with your use of the Offering, those fees will be charged as described on the Site or in the user interface of the Offering. Such fees may be calculated by combining a fee charged by us and a fee charged by a Third Party Offering that provides certain functionality related to the Offering. For those Offerings which entail an Order or Paid Plan, we calculate and bill fees and charges according to your Order or Paid Plan. For such Offerings, on the first day of each billing period, you will pay us the applicable fees (the “Base Fees”) and any applicable taxes based on the Offerings in the Paid Plan. In addition, for particular Orders, we may issue an invoice to you for all charges above the applicable threshold for your Paid Plan which constitute overage fees for the previous billing period. If you make any other changes to the Offerings during a billing period (for example, upgrading or downgrading your Paid Plan), we will apply any additional charges or credits to the next billing period. We may bill you more frequently for fees accrued at our discretion upon notice to you. You will pay all fees in U.S. dollars unless the particular Offering specifies a different form of payment or otherwise agreed to by you and us in writing. All amounts payable by you under this Agreement will be paid to us without setoff or counterclaim, and without any deduction or withholding. Fees and charges for any new Offering or new feature of an Offering will be effective when we use commercially reasonable efforts to communicate updated fees and charges through our Site, the interface of the Offering itself, or other public channels or, if you are on a Paid Plan, upon commercially reasonable efforts to notify you directly, but we may expressly state when notifying you that another effective date applies. We may increase or add new fees and charges for any existing Offerings you are using by using commercially reasonable efforts to notify users of the Offerings through our Site, the interface of the Offering itself, other public channels or, if you are on a Paid Plan, by giving you 30 days’ notice. Unless otherwise specified in an Order, all Paid Plan amounts due under this Agreement are payable within 30 days following receipt of your invoice. We may elect to charge you interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) on all late payments.

4.3 Taxes. Each party will be responsible, as required under applicable law, for identifying and paying all taxes and other governmental fees and charges (and any penalties, interest, and other additions thereto) that are imposed on that party upon or with respect to the transactions and payments under this Agreement. All fees payable by you are exclusive taxes unless otherwise noted. We reserve the right to withhold taxes where required.

5. Temporary Suspension; Limiting API Requests.

5.1 Generally. We may suspend your right to access or use any portion or all of the Offerings immediately if we determine:

(a) your use of the Offerings (i) poses a security risk to the Offerings or any third party, (ii) could adversely impact our systems, the Offerings, or the systems of any other user, (iii) could subject us, our affiliates, or any third party to liability, or (iv) could be unlawful;

(b) you are, or any End User is, in breach of this Agreement;

(c) you are in breach of your payment obligations under Section 4 for 30 days or longer; or

(d) for entities, you have ceased to operate in the ordinary course, made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar disposition of your assets, or become the subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or similar proceeding.

5.2 Effect of Suspension. If we suspend your right to access or use any portion or all of an Offering:

(a) you remain responsible for all fees and charges you incur during the period of suspension; and

(b) you will not be entitled to any fee credits for any period of suspension.

5.3 Limiting API Requests. We retain sole discretion to limit your API requests (“API Requests”) submitted in conjunction with your use of an Offering at any time if your usage of the Offering exceeds the usage threshold specified in your Paid Plan or otherwise on the Site or user interface of the Offering. Further, excessive API requests, as determined by Consensys in our sole discretion, may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your access to an account or to your use of the applicable Offering. Consensys is not required but will endeavor, when reasonable, to warn an account owner or user prior to suspension.

6. Term; Termination.

6.1 Term. For Offerings subject to a Paid Plan, the term of this Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and will remain in effect until terminated under this Section 6 or by separate written agreement. Any notice of termination of this Agreement by either party to the other must include a Termination Date that complies with the notice periods in Section 6.2 or the Appendix 1 - Additional Offerings as applicable. For Offerings that are not subject to a Paid Plan, the term of this Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and will remain in effect until you stop accessing or using the Offerings.

6.2 Termination.

(a) Termination for Convenience. If you are not on a Paid Plan, you may terminate this Agreement for any reason by ceasing use of the Offering. For Paid Plans, Consensys may terminate this Agreement for any reason after providing 30 calendar days’ written notice.

(b) Termination for Cause.

(i) By Either Party. Either party may terminate this Agreement for cause if the other party is in material breach of this Agreement and the material breach remains uncured for a period of 30 days from receipt of the other party’s notice of breach.

(ii) By Us. We may also terminate this Agreement for cause immediately (A) if we have the right to suspend under Section 5, (B) if our relationship with a third-party partner who provides software or other technology we use to provide the Offerings expires, terminates, or requires us to change the way we provide the software or other technology as part of the Offerings, or (C) in order to avoid undue risk of violating the law.

6.3 Effect of Termination. Upon the Termination Date:

(i) all your rights under this Agreement immediately terminate; and

(ii) each party remains responsible for all fees and charges it has incurred through the Termination Date and are responsible for any fees and charges it incurs during the post-termination period;

(iii) the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement to the full extent necessary for their enforcement and for the protection of the party in whose favor they operate. For instance, should this Agreement between you and us terminate, any dispute raised after you stop accessing or using the Offerings will be subject to the applicable provisions of this Agreement if that dispute relates to your prior access or use.

For any use of the Offerings after the Termination Date, the terms of this Agreement will again apply and, if your use is under a Paid Plan, you will pay the applicable fees at the rates under Section 4.

7. Proprietary Rights.

7.1 Your Content. Depending on the Offering, you may share Content with us. Except as provided in this Section 7, we obtain no rights under this Agreement from you (or your licensors) to Your Content; however, you consent to our use of Your Content in any manner that is consistent with the purpose of your use of the Offerings or that otherwise facilitates providing the Offerings to you.

7.2 Offerings License. We or our licensors own all right, title, and interest in and to the Offerings, and all related technology and intellectual property rights.

Except as provided in this Section 7.2, you obtain no rights under this Agreement from us, our affiliates or our licensors to the Offerings, including any related intellectual property rights. Some of Our Content and Third-Party Content may be provided to you under a separate license, such as the Apache License, Version 2.0, or other open source license. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and any separate license, the separate license will prevail with respect to Our Content or Third-Party Content that is the subject of such separate license.

7.3 License Restrictions. Neither you nor any End User will use the Offerings in any manner or for any purpose other than as expressly permitted by this Agreement. Except for as authorized, neither you nor any End User will, or will attempt to (a) modify, distribute, alter, tamper with, repair, or otherwise create derivative works of any Content included in the Offerings (except to the extent Content included in the Offerings is provided to you under a separate license that expressly permits the creation of derivative works), (b) reverse engineer, disassemble, or decompile the Offerings or apply any other process or procedure to derive the source code of any software included in the Offerings (except to the extent applicable law doesn’t allow this restriction), (c) access or use the Offerings in a way intended to avoid incurring fees or exceeding usage limits or quotas, (d) use scraping techniques to mine or otherwise scrape data except as permitted by a Plan, or (e) resell or sublicense the Offerings unless otherwise agreed in writing. You will not use Our Marks unless you obtain our prior written consent. You will not misrepresent or embellish the relationship between us and you (including by expressing or implying that we support, sponsor, endorse, or contribute to you or your business endeavors). You will not imply any relationship or affiliation between us and you except as expressly permitted by this Agreement.

7.4 Suggestions. If you provide any Suggestions to us or our affiliates, we and our affiliates will be entitled to use the Suggestions without restriction. You hereby irrevocably assign to us all right, title, and interest in and to the Suggestions and agree to provide us any assistance we require to document, perfect, and maintain our rights in the Suggestions.

7.5 U.S. Government Users. If you are a U.S. Government End User, we are licensing the Offerings to you as a “Commercial Item” as that term is defined in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (see 48 C.F.R. § 2.101), and the rights we grant you to the Offerings are the same as the rights we grant to all others under these Terms of Use.

8. Indemnification.

8.1 General.

(a) You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates and licensors, and each of their respective employees, officers, directors, and representatives from and against any Losses arising out of or relating to any claim concerning: (a) breach of this Agreement or violation of applicable law by you; or (b) a dispute between you and any of your customers or users. You will reimburse us for reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, associated with claims described in (a) and (b) above.

(b) We will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless you and your employees, officers, directors, and representatives from and against any Losses arising out of or relating to any claim concerning our material and intentional breach of this Agreement.

8.2 Intellectual Property.

(a) Subject to the limitations in this Section 8, you will defend Consensys, its affiliates, and their respective employees, officers, and directors against any third-party claim alleging that any of Your Content infringes or misappropriates that third party’s intellectual property rights, and will pay the amount of any adverse final judgment or settlement.

(b) Subject to the limitations in this Section 8 and the limitations in Section 10, we will defend you and your employees, officers, and directors against any third-party claim alleging that the Offerings infringe or misappropriate that third party’s intellectual property rights, and will pay the amount of any adverse final judgment or settlement. However, we will not be required to spend more than $200,000 pursuant to this Section 8, including without limitation attorneys’ fees, court costs, settlements, judgments, and reimbursement costs.

(c) Neither party will have obligations or liability under this Section 8.2 arising from infringement by you combining the Offerings with any other product, service, software, data, content or method. In addition, we will have no obligations or liability arising from your use of the Offerings after we have notified you to discontinue such use. The remedies provided in this Section 8.2 are the sole and exclusive remedies for any third-party claims of infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights by the Offerings or by Your Content.

8.3 Process. In no event will a party agree to any settlement of any claim that involves any commitment, other than the payment of money, without the written consent of the other party.

9. Disclaimers; Risk.

9.1 DISCLAIMER.

9.2 RISKS. OUR OFFERINGS RELY ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS ETHEREUM. SOME OFFERINGS ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASED RISK THROUGH YOUR POTENTIAL MISUSE OF THINGS SUCH AS PUBLIC/PRIVATE KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY, OR FAILING TO PROPERLY UPDATE OR RUN SOFTWARE TO ACCOMMODATE PROTOCOL UPGRADES, LIKE THE TRANSITION TO PROOF OF STAKE CONSENSUS. BY USING THE OFFERINGS YOU EXPLICITLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND ACCEPT THESE HEIGHTENED RISKS. YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE FINANCIALLY AND TECHNICALLY SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THE INHERENT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH USING CRYPTOGRAPHIC AND BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SYSTEMS AND UPGRADING YOUR SOFTWARE AND PROCESSES TO ACCOMMODATE OFFERING AND PROTOCOL UPGRADES, AND THAT YOU HAVE A WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF THE USAGE AND INTRICACIES OF DIGITAL ASSETS SUCH AS ETHER (ETH) AND OTHER DIGITAL TOKENS, SUCH AS THOSE FOLLOWING THE ERC-20 TOKEN STANDARD.

YOU FURTHER UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THAT DIGITAL ASSETS PRESENT MARKET VOLATILITY RISK, TECHNICAL SOFTWARE RISKS, REGULATORY RISKS, AND CYBERSECURITY RISKS.

YOU AGREE THAT CONSENSYS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REGULATORY STATUS OR TREATMENT IN ANY JURISDICTION OF ANY DIGITAL ASSETS THAT YOU MAY ACCESS OR TRANSACT WITH USING CONSENSYS OFFERINGS.

THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW.

11. Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.

11.1 Binding Arbitration. Any dispute, claim or controversy (“Claim”) relating in any way to this Agreement, the Site, or your use of the Offerings will be resolved by binding arbitration as provided in this Section 11, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.

11.1.1 If you are located in the United States: This agreement and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the expedited procedures set forth in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”) as those Rules exist on the effective date of this Agreement, including Rules 16.1 and 16.2 of those Rules. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding, and non-appealable. Judgment upon the award may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. Neither party shall sue the other party other than as provided herein or for enforcement of this clause or of the arbitrator’s award; any such suit may be brought only in a Federal District Court or a Texas state court located in Tarrant County, Texas. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement including any claim that all or any part of the Agreement is void or voidable. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we and you waive any right to a jury trial. Notwithstanding the foregoing we and you both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.

11.1.2 If you are located in the United Kingdom: This agreement and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of England and Wales. Any dispute, claim or controversy relating in any way to this Agreement, the Offerings, your use of the Offerings, or to any products or services licensed or distributed by us will be resolved by binding arbitration as provided in this clause. Prior to commencing any formal arbitration proceedings, parties shall first seek settlement of any claim by mediation in accordance with the LCIA Mediation Rules, which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. If the dispute is not settled by mediation within 14 days of the commencement of the mediation, or such further period as the parties shall agree in writing, the dispute shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the LCIA Rules, which are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. The language to be used in the mediation and in the arbitration shall be English. The seat or legal place of arbitration shall be London.

Appendix 1 - Additional Offerings

In addition to the Service Offerings described in the Terms, the ffollowing services ("Additional Offerings") may be made available by Consensys to You. The provisions for each Additional Offering below apply to your use of such Additional Offerings, supplementing the other applicable provisions of the Terms. If you do not use any Additional Offerings, then this Appendix does not apply to you.

1. Staking Services

When you hold Supported Digital Assets in your MetaMask wallet you may be given the option to license our software that you may use to “stake” on your own behalf these assets in a third party proof-of-stake (POS) network. Please visit our staking information page for further details on how proof of stake consensus mechanism works.

1.1. General. Through MetaMask Staking, you can stake specific assets to receive rewards for securing Proof-of-Stake (POS) networks. You may choose to stake your assets by delegating to a Consensys-operated validator node or to a third-party validator node (both a “Designated Validator Node”). If you choose to stake your assets with a third-party validator node (including the “Lido Staked ETH” node or any other provider), then such staking is subject to the third party’s staking terms and conditions. CONSENSYS DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY ADVICE OR MAKE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT ENGAGING IN STAKING OR CHOOSING A VALIDATOR. Your choice to participate in staking and which method to do so are entirely your own. Consensys reserves the right to modify the list of referenced validators at any time without prior notice.

1.2. Staking Rewards and Fees. You understand and agree that the delegation of staking rights to a validator operator listed in Metamask does not grant to your benefit any right to request payment of any kind, but merely a potential right to share a reward perceived by the validator. If you stake your assets through MetaMask Staking, the Designated Validator Node will be acting as a transaction validator on the applicable Proof-of-Stake (POS) network. If the Designated Validator Node successfully validates a block of transactions in that network, you may receive staking rewards granted by such network and Consensys will receive a flat service fee (at the rate indicated either on the Site or in the user interface of the Offering). Your reward will be determined by the protocols of the applicable network. Please be aware that some Proof-of-Stake networks require that a certain amount of staked assets be “locked” (restricted from any use, sale or transfer) for a certain period of time while staking.

1.3 No Custody. Consensys operates non-custodial services, including staking, meaning we do not have access to the security key that permits you to access the funds you have staked and any rewards you have earned. We are not able to take custody of your rewards or assets. You acknowledge that you and not Consensys are responsible for safeguarding the security key that controls access to your staked tokens and your rewards.

1.4 Disclaimer and Slashing. Staking is provided “as is”. Consensys is not responsible in any way for any failure by any supported blockchain network to transfer rewards (including any risks of “slashing”) or for the loss, destruction, or transfer of rewards to the incorrect wallet address. Consensys does not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation of the staking services or that it will correct all defects or prevent third-party disruptions or unauthorized third party access.

1.5 Suspension, Termination and Withdrawal. You may un-stake or stop using the services at any time. Depending on the protocol and the provider withdrawal processing queue, which Consensys does not control, the unstaking process may take hours or even days to complete. Any expected unstaking periods are estimates only. You may have to complete additional steps to claim your rewards depending on the third party service provider that is supporting the validators you chose to use. Consensys may suspend or terminate this staking offering for any reason in its sole discretion and is under no obligation to disclose the details of its decision to take such action with you, but if Consensys does so, Consensys will not itself inhibit access to your staked tokens or to any rewards you have earned, but we take no responsibility for any third party service provider or any third party protocol. In certain offerings, such as MetaMask Validator Staking, Consensys may be able to initiate the un-stake process to the wallet you staked with. Upon 90 days notice from Consensys of termination of the offering or suspension of your access, you must initiate and complete the un-stake process. After Upon expiration of that 90 day notice period, in its sole discretion, Consensys may initiate the un-stake process on your behalf and your staked tokens and any rewards issued by the third party protocol to the wallet you staked with and will not accessible by Consensys.

1.6 No Guarantee of Rewards. CONSENSYS DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE STAKING REWARDS OR ANY STAKING REWARD RATES. SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER OF THE REWARDS IS SUBJECT TO THE PROOF-OF-STAKE NETWORKS AND IS NOT UNDER CONSENSYS’ CONTROL. REWARD RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE UNDERLYING PROTOCOLS AND NOT BY CONSENSYS AND MAY FLUCTUATE, INCLUDING BECAUSE THE UNDERLYING SERVICES GENERATING REWARDS ARE PERFORMED IMPROPERLY.

   La teoría del control es un campo interdisciplinario de la ingeniería y la matemática que se centra en el comportamiento de sistemas dinámicos con entradas y salidas. Cuando se aplica a sistemas complejos dinámicos y multidimensionales, se involucran conceptos avanzados que abarcan sistemas no lineales, multivariables y distribuidos en el tiempo y el espacio.
   
   ### 1. **Conceptos Fundamentales de la Teoría del Control**
   
   #### **Sistemas Dinámicos**
   - **Descripción**: Un sistema dinámico es un conjunto de elementos que interactúan en el tiempo según ciertas reglas matemáticas. Estos sistemas pueden ser representados mediante ecuaciones diferenciales y de diferencia.
   - **Estados y Variables**: Los sistemas dinámicos se describen en términos de variables de estado que capturan la información esencial sobre el estado del sistema en cualquier momento.
   
   #### **Controladores y Realimentación**
   - **Control de Retroalimentación**: Utiliza la información del estado actual del sistema para ajustar las entradas con el fin de alcanzar un comportamiento deseado.
   - **Controladores PID**: Los controladores Proporcional-Integral-Derivativo son fundamentales en la ingeniería de control, usados para mantener una variable de proceso a un valor deseado.
   
   ### 2. **Sistemas Complejos y Multidimensionales**
   
   #### **Sistemas No Lineales**
   - **Descripción**: Los sistemas no lineales son aquellos donde las relaciones entre variables no son proporcionales, lo que puede llevar a comportamientos complejos como bifurcaciones y caos.
   - **Modelado y Control**: Los métodos de linealización y técnicas avanzadas como el control adaptativo y el control robusto se utilizan para manejar la no linealidad.
   
   #### **Sistemas Multivariables (MIMO)**
   - **Descripción**: Los sistemas MIMO (Multiple Input, Multiple Output) tienen múltiples entradas y salidas interconectadas. Son comunes en procesos industriales y sistemas de telecomunicaciones.
   - **Control y Estabilidad**: El diseño de controladores para sistemas MIMO implica el uso de técnicas como el control óptimo y la teoría de sistemas lineales.
   
   #### **Sistemas Distribuidos**
   - **Descripción**: Los sistemas distribuidos se caracterizan por variables que dependen del tiempo y el espacio, como los sistemas térmicos o los ecosistemas.
   - **Métodos de Control**: Se emplean técnicas como el control basado en modelos y los métodos de elementos finitos para manejar la distribución espacial de las variables de estado.
   
   ### 3. **Aplicaciones de la Teoría del Control en Sistemas Complejos**
   
   #### **Ingeniería de Procesos**
   - **Descripción**: En la ingeniería de procesos, se controlan sistemas multivariables para optimizar la producción y minimizar el consumo de energía.
   - **Ejemplo**: Control de procesos químicos mediante el uso de controladores predictivos multivariables.
   
   #### **Robótica y Automatización**
   - **Descripción**: En robótica, se aplican controles avanzados para manejar la dinámica compleja de los robots, especialmente en entornos no estructurados.
   - **Ejemplo**: Controladores no lineales y de retroalimentación para la estabilización y seguimiento de trayectorias en robots móviles.
   
   #### **Redes Eléctricas**
   - **Descripción**: Las redes eléctricas modernas son sistemas distribuidos que requieren técnicas de control avanzadas para garantizar la estabilidad y la eficiencia.
   - **Ejemplo**: Uso de controladores distribuídos y técnicas de optimización para el manejo de redes eléctricas inteligentes.
   
   ### 4. **Herramientas y Técnicas Avanzadas**
   
   #### **Modelado Matemático**
   - **Ecuaciones Diferenciales Parciales**: Utilizadas para modelar sistemas distribuidos donde las variables cambian con el tiempo y el espacio.
   - **Métodos Numéricos**: Utilizados para resolver modelos matemáticos complejos, incluyendo el método de elementos finitos y la simulación Monte Carlo.
   
   #### **Control Óptimo**
   - **Principio de Optimalidad de Bellman**: Se utiliza en el diseño de controladores que optimizan un criterio de rendimiento específico.
   - **Programación Dinámica**: Método de resolución de problemas complejos dividiéndolos en subproblemas más simples.
   
   #### **Redes Neuronales y Algoritmos Genéticos**
   - **Redes Neuronales**: Utilizadas para el control adaptativo y la identificación de sistemas no lineales.
   - **Algoritmos Genéticos**: Métodos evolutivos para la optimización de sistemas complejos, especialmente en contextos donde las soluciones tradicionales no son viables.

{% data reusables.secret-scanning.enterprise-enable-secret-scanning %}

## Detection of pattern pairs

{% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning_caps %} will only detect pattern pairs, such as AWS Access Keys and Secrets, if the ID and the secret are found in the same file, and both are pushed to the repository. Pair matching helps reduce false positives since both elements of a pair (the ID and the secret) must be used together to access the provider's resource.

Pairs pushed to different files, or not pushed to the same repository, will not result in alerts. For more information about the supported pattern pairs, see the table in "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/supported-secret-scanning-patterns)."

{% ifversion secret-scanning-validity-check %}

## About legacy GitHub tokens

For {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} tokens, we check the validity of the secret to determine whether the secret is active or inactive. This means that for legacy tokens, {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} won't detect a {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} {% data variables.product.pat_generic %} on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %}. Similarly, a {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} {% data variables.product.pat_generic %} won't be found on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}.

{% endif %}

## Push protection limitations

If push protection did not detect a secret that you think should have been detected, then you should first check that push protection supports the secret type in the list of supported secrets. For further information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/supported-secret-scanning-patterns#supported-secrets)."

If your secret is in the supported list, there are various reasons why push protection may not detect it.

* Push protection only blocks leaked secrets on a subset of the most identifiable user-alerted patterns. Contributors can trust security defenses when such secrets are blocked as these are the patterns that have the lowest number of false positives.
* The version of your secret may be old. {% data reusables.secret-scanning.push-protection-older-tokens %}
* The push may be too large, for example, if you're trying to push thousands of large files. A push protection scan may time out and not block a user if the push is too large. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will still scan and create alerts, if needed, after the push.
* If the push results in the detection of over five new secrets, we will only show you the first five (we will always show you a maximum of five secrets at one time).
* If a push contains over 1,000 existing secrets (that is, secrets for which alerts have already been created), push protection will not block the push.
